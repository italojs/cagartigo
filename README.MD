# Cagartigo

It's a script for dump arxiv data.
Basically the script has a logic fo build [arxiv ids](https://arxiv.org/help/arxiv_identifier  ) -> make branches of 500 ids -> make an request for arxiv's api via [arxiv lib](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py)

## Usage
For now it's just an script, but the idea is usage it like a CLI in the future.

`python main.py`

see your `log.txt` file

Check the commented code and [arxiv lib](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py) for consume others data.
